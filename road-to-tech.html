          <h2>FIRST Robotics ü§ñ</h2>
          <p>In high school, I was heavily involved in my school‚Äôs robotics team, FRC Team 1403. I served as the Design Captain for three years, designing the CAD models of the robot and creating technical drawings for the Mechanical subteam so that they could manufacture and assemble subsystems accordingly. I also ran the CNC machine, which manufactured precise parts according to GCode. For this reason, I considered pursuing mechanical engineering in college before pivoting to computer science. However, the small amount of programming that I was exposed to when operating the CNC machine made me interested in at least exploring computer science a bit more.</p>

          <h2>NYU CREATE Lab üïπÔ∏è</h2>
          <p>The summer after my junior year of high school, I decided to take a course at NYU called Coding For Game Design. Although it was my first time coding and I struggled at first, I drew on support from my professors and classmates and came out of the course having made a platformer game using HTML, JavaScript, Phaser3, and Tiled. The satisfaction of owning a product from end-to-end made me want to keep pursuing CS to keep creating. My senior year, I took my first formal CS course and applied to colleges with the plan of pursuing CS.</p>

          <h2>TechTogether New York üèôÔ∏è</h2>
          <p>My second month at NYU, I decided to go to my first hackathon, TechTogether New York. At that point, I hadn‚Äôt had too much exposure to CS beyond my intro course, so I didn‚Äôt know too much about the different fields within CS. TechTogether introduced me to important concepts like version control and APIs. My group and I ended up creating the beginnings of a language learning app using IBM Watson Image Recognition and even trained my own machine learning model. This first prototype could only recognize 5 objects but the support we gained from the organizers and the 1517 Fund gave us the motivation to continue pursuing it after the hackathon was over.</p>

          <h2>What I'm doing now ü§î</h2>
          <p>I‚Äôm currently a sophomore at NYU, taking Computer Systems Organization as a way to better understand programs at a more fundamental level and a couple courses in more specialty areas such as web development, data science, and iOS development to see what I‚Äôm interested in pursuing in the future and to expand my skill set. The language learning app I created at TechTogether is now called Terra. It's now available on the <a href = "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/terra-pocket-chinese-learning/id1498859549"> app store</a>
